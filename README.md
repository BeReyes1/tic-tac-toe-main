For this project, I mostly went function by function using the comments as a guide to fill out each function. For instance, the first function looked for an empty holder. I added two checks to return false. Get the index with the function and create a bit to assign to a holder. 

I had to edit one class being the Bit class. For a couple functions it suggested to move a bit to a holder's position. The moveTo() function was unused so, I filled it out to be able to use it.

I worked on Windows.
